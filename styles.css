/* styles.css — lightweight wrapper that imports the canonical stylesheet.
   The large monolithic stylesheet was moved to styles/main.css for better maintainability.
   Tombstone: removed big in-file stylesheet; keep this wrapper so HTML pages need not change.
   removed CSS blob previously here: // removed large stylesheet content
